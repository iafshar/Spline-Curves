# Spline-Curves
Implementation of de Casteljau Algorithm, and variations of it, to draw spline curves

The user creates a control polygon by clicking anywhere on the screen. This would create a new point.
Pressing '0' would just show the control polygon, pressing '1' would show the bezier spline, pressing '2' would show the b-spline, and pressing '3' would show the subdivided control polygon that converge to the b-spline.
Pressing '+'/'-' increase/decrease the resolution for the BÃ©zier spline and B-spline. 
Pressing 'a'/'z' increase/decrease the depth of recursive subdivisions for the subdivided curve.
